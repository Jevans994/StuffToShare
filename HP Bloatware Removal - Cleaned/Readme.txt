 Create date: 15/10/2025
 Purpose: Creates a Master list of HP apps to be removed, Determines the correct method for uninstall
 and removes the applications - The list order matters, removing from top to bottom as some apps have
 dependencies. 

 This script is verbose enough to remove MOST applications if added to the list not just HP, and is designed to be
 Run manually as an admin OR if packaged can be deployed via Intune

 Dependancy files - There is a file called UninstallHPCO.iss that is required to be in the same directory
 as the running script, this handles the uninstall for HP Connection Optimizer if present.
